## Examples of URI & URL

A URL is a type of URI

### URL

I ahve that covered already

### URI







## Compare and contrast Route vs URL

**Route:**
- A route is a defined pathway in a web application that corresponds to a specific component or page.
- It is used to handle navigation within the application and rendering of different views.
- In the context of web frameworks like SolidJS, a route is defined using a specific component (like `<Route>` in SolidJS) and it maps a specific URL path to a component.
- A route can contain parameters (like `/users/:id`), which can be used to render different views based on the parameter value.
- Routes do not include the protocol or domain, they are specific to the application's internal structure.

**URL (Uniform Resource Locator):**
- A URL is the address that uniquely identifies a resource on the internet.
- It consists of a protocol (like `http` or `https`), domain (like `example.com`), path (like `/users`), and optional query parameters (like `?id=1`).
- The URL is what the user sees in the browser's address bar and uses to navigate the internet.
- While a URL can have query parameters, these are not typically matched against in routing.

In summary, a route is an internal pathway within an application that maps to specific components or views, while a URL is an internet-wide address that identifies a specific resource.

GitHub Copilot: **Route in a Web Application:**
- A route in a web application is a defined pathway that corresponds to a specific component or page.
- It is used to handle navigation within the application and rendering of different views.
- In client-side frameworks like React or Angular, routes are defined using specific components (like `<Route>` in React) and they map a specific URL path to a component.
- These routes are handled on the client side, meaning the server sends the entire application to the client, and navigation between routes does not require a server request.
- A route can contain parameters (like `/users/:id`), which can be used to render different views based on the parameter value.

**Route in a Web Server:**
- A route in a web server is a defined pathway that corresponds to a specific server-side function or resource.
- It is used to handle incoming HTTP requests and send back appropriate responses.
- In server-side frameworks like Express.js, routes are defined using specific methods (like `app.get()` or `app.post()`) and they map a specific URL path to a function.
- These routes are handled on the server side, meaning each navigation to a new route requires a new request to the server.
- A route can contain parameters (like `/users/:id`), which can be used to handle requests for different resources based on the parameter value.

In summary, a route in a web application is used for client-side navigation and view rendering, while a route in a web server is used for handling server-side requests and responses.
